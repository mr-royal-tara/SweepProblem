# SweepProblem

find out the minimum number of mobile sensor in a bounded region by converting it into the point of interest in the presence of the obstacle. We will be doing this by using area sweep coverage to make sure that we have found out the minimum number of the mobile sensor for given set of point of interest where the specified boundary of the area of interest is continuously monitored by sensor nodes.
